Part of my University Project for my Project Management and Development module. InigmaIT Employment is an employment agency, 
used to store staff, employer, job and candidate data, and enables candidates to search and apply for jobs. Programmed in Visual Studio; the ASPX pages were coded using C#, HTML and CSS.
